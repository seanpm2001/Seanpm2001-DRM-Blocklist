### Notes

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the notes section</b></p></summary>

- [View drafts](/Seanpm2001/DRM-Blocklist/Drafts/)
- I would have posted this on April 17th, but I was in the middle of a 5 day pause from new repositories, so that I could catch up on other repositories.
- I am new to hosting/maintaining a blocklist, and this is my first time using the `Hosts file` language. Things likely won't work perfectly the first time, so please give feedback if you notice something isn't going right.
- Right now, the list mainly consists of mainstream sites.
- I plan to accept issues with new entries, but for the beginning, I am only going to accept issues that have the most links, as I want to build this list to be massive early on, then gradually increase and maintain it.
- - Please post issues with links, but add more links in replies to increase the chance of me accepting it. I won't always selectively target large troves, and will go for individual links at times as well.
- During the first 3 drafts, I didn't put forth 100% effort into this project, as I had other things to work on, and this project was too negative to be done at certain times of the day.
- The issue that helped start this project [:octocat: `BlocklistProject#1213`](https://github.com/blocklistproject/Lists/issues/1213)

Common definitions within this project.

### DRM

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the DRM definition section</b></p></summary>

- Stands for: `Digital Restrictive Measures` or `Digital restrictions management` (GNU definition)
- Does not stand for: `Digital Rights Management`
- Forms: `WideVine` `FairPlay` `Adobe Digital Editions` `Valve Anti-Cheat` `PrimeTime` `EME` `etc.`

Digital software/malware that attempts to take away the ownership rights and prevent the copying of files that the user has received through a digital distribution medium. DRM is constantly cracked, it is wasteful to both the environment (computing resources required to implement it) and talent (billions of dollars and millions of hours of time wasted per year on something that is not necessary, and can be cracked within days)

</details> <!-- End of DRM definition section !-->

### EME

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the EME definition section</b></p></summary>

- Stands for: `Encrypted Media Extensions`
- Does not stand for: `Extended Media Encryption`
- Forms: `EME` `DRM`

A type of DRM (light DRM) that was controversially accepted as an Internet standard (due to support from sites like Netflix) but has caused monopolization of Internet software development, and hindered the progress of innovation (as all DRM does) this DRM tries to prevent users from right clicking/copying a file on a webpage, but isn't as heavy as a DRM scheme like WideVine. This type of DRM typically doesn't have to be asked to be used, and will run from the browser itself (even in Firefox)

### Light DRM

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the Light DRM definition section</b></p></summary>

- Stands for: `Light Digital Restrictive Measures`
- Does not stand for: `Light Digital Rights Management`
- Forms: `EME` `DRM`

DRM that tries to prevent users from right clicking/copying a file on a webpage, but isn't as heavy as a DRM scheme like WideVine. This type of DRM typically doesn't have to be asked to be used, and will run from the browser itself (even in Firefox)

## Testing

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the testing section</b></p></summary>

### How to test for heavy presence of DRM

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the testing for heavy presence of DRM section</b></p></summary>

1. Load the website in Firefox (without DRM installed/enabled)
2. If there is a yellow popup by Firefox that says "you must enable DRM to access certain parts of this page" (non-verbatim text) then the site uses DRM and should be added to the list.

### How to test for presence of light DRM (EME)

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the testing for presence of light DRM section</b></p></summary>

1. Load the website in Firefox (without DRM installed/enabled)
2. Try right clicking various pieces of media on the page
3. If the save as option is gr√¶yed out or not present, the site likely uses EME
4. Additionally, if there is a yellow popup by Firefox that says "you must enable DRM to access certain parts of this page" (non-verbatim text) then the site uses DRM and should be added to the DRM list as well.
